/// each reimplementing the Upload Resolution check.

/// Reads `settings.uploadQuality` (the global "Original" / "High" toggle
/// on the Settings screen — see settings_model.dart /
/// admin_settings_screen.dart):
/// - `"Original"`: [bytes] are returned unchanged.
/// - `"High"`: for photos, [bytes] are downscaled/re-encoded via
///   [ImageCompressionService] (long edge ~2048px, JPEG quality ~85).
///   For videos, compression isn't wired up yet — see TODO below — so
///   [bytes] are returned unchanged for now rather than silently
///   dropping quality settings on a format we can't safely re-encode
///   client-side.
///
/// [forceCompress], when non-null, overrides the global setting above
/// for this one call — this is how the upload wizard's per-batch
/// "Compress Media" / "Keep Original Quality" toggles (job.compress /
/// job.keepOriginalQuality on UploadJobModel) take effect: the batch
/// queue derives a bool from those two switches and passes it here so
/// an explicit per-batch choice wins over whatever the global default
/// happens to be for that job. Leave it null (as the single-file
/// uploader does) to fall through to the global setting untouched.
