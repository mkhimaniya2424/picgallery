"""Auto-delete scheduler — permanently removes Media rows (and their
stored files) that are older than ``settings.MEDIA_RETENTION_HOURS``.

Designed to be called from a long-running asyncio background task
started in ``app/main.py``'s lifespan, **not** from a request handler.

The deletion path is identical to the manual ``POST /media/{id}/permanent``
endpoint so both code paths stay in sync:
  1. ``delete_media_folder(owner_id, media_id)`` -- wipes original +
     thumbnail from local disk *or* R2, whichever backend is active.
  2. ``db.delete(media)`` + ``db.commit()`` -- removes the DB row,
     which cascades to any child rows (likes, comments, face embeddings,
     download events) via the FK ``ondelete`` rules in the schema.

Both active media **and** already-trashed (``is_deleted=True``) media
older than the cutoff are deleted -- there is no reason to keep trashed
files around once the retention window closes.
